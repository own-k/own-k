# Komron — AI-focused Developer

AI-focused developer based in Uzbekistan, building user-friendly web experiences and practical AI prototypes.

My core stack is **React + TypeScript + Tailwind**, and I use **Framer** for fast web development and polished prototypes. For UI and planning, I work in **Figma** and **Notion**. I also prototype with **Google AI Studio**, and use **Google Antigravity** as an assistant for research, brainstorming, and development workflows.
